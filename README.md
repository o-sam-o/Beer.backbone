# Beer.backbone

Overview
--------
Backbone.js backed rendering of my Flickr beer collection.

The Premise
-----------
Create a photographic collection of beer bottles (ideally that I have drunk).
While I try to ensure the label is readable, image quality is not a priority.
Most photos are taken with my phone and often in poor lighting conditions.
The same beer is allowed to feature multiple times in the collection if there is some kind
of variation in the bottle.

The Tech
--------
The collection is stored on Flickr and this
site has been built on top of their REST API.  The aim was to build a rich
dynamic site with no server side code.
This is achieved with the use of the Backbone.js MVC framework and
Bootstrap for the look and feel.
This site has been developed for Chrome
and mostly works in Firefox, no effort has been made to make it IE compatible.
